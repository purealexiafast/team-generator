# Team Profile Generator 

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

This assignment was to use Node.js command line to generate information about employees in a HTML page. The information displayed was name, id, email, ect. Testing the code was a key component in this assignment. The testing was the part of the assignment that I found the most challenging as it was new territory. However I was excited to see all my tests pass once I was fininshed. Overall this was a fun assignment to accomplish.
